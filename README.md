# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I tried to create a kind of site of Shipping Company with 3 vessels in the fleet. First page is introduction of the ContShip Company with links to the data of vessels in the fleet. I tried to fulfil, as much as possible, requirements of Project 0. Therefore styles of first and second vessels pages are linked to styles.css file, that is created by SSAS from styles.scss and styles of third vessel used Bootstrap. Unfortunately, i couldn't find the way how to replicate the view of my pages in Bootstrap scripts, and i didn't want to repeat the same commands, that is why the view of page with third vessel is different from others. But if i change styles link of that page to CSS file it should give the same view with other pages.
Content of the file: readme.md file, three .jpg pictures of ships, three .png picture of flags, main page Contship.html, three additional .html file for particular vessels, styles.scss, styles.css.map and styles.css files.
